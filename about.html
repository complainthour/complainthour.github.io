  <h1> About </h1>
  <p> I'm a software engineer in the New York area. My technical interests include testing, CI/CD pipelines, cybersecurity and configuration management. I'm not a web developer but I'll try to make this site usable. I love to write (sometimes in the form of a complaint :) ). Contact -- github username [at] gmail or submit a pull request :) </p>
