<h1> Non tech </h1>

	<h3>15 August 2020: Tech Interviewing is a Skill </h3>
		<p>My main point here is that the thing that make us good at interviewing are generally things we can learn over time as they are based in critical thinking about, and pattern recongition of, math and science. And while they are not bestowed upon us at birth, they do take many years to develop and therefore some people are in a(n) (dis)advantaged position based on factors largely out of their control. </p>

		<h4> Part I: When You're Surrounded By Perfect Candidates, But You're Not One Of Them </h4>
			<p>I went to college with a lot of really smart people, and I live on planet Earth which has a large pool of really smart people. In general, on Earth, I feel pretty smart. In college I felt like the dumbest one there. Of course when you go somewhere like a college, where everyone was their high school valedictorian with high SAT scores and a million extracurriculars, you're no longer going to be #1. But I felt dumb in a new way that I didn't even fully process until after I graduated. I felt dumb not because I was no longer the top of my class, but because only certain types of "smart" were really conducive to appearing smart as a student in most of my CS courses. The types of smart that led to good grades and awards and prestigious internships were the types built up over many years, from early childhood, that compounded lessons from areas outside the standard school curriculum with reasoning and pattern recognition skills that kids pick up quickly when taught by a very educated adult. </p>

			<p>These hyper-intelligent, worldly, majestically-educated students had been doing math for fun since middle school and programming before I ever knew what programming was. But we both got into $Competitive_School and they weren't any smarter than I was. They were just more educated before we arrived as freshmen. </p>

			<p> And it turns out that being hyper-intelligent, worldly, and majestically-educated makes you really, really good at the technical interviews which gatekeep the tech world's most sought-after companies (aka the FAANGs). For someone who has been doing math as a practice (and not just a public school course) for many years, whiteboard questions about graph theory are (I would guess) an exercise of their long-held talents that they can display with some effort. For someone like me, those questions are a nightmare. Data Structures was hard. Discrete Math/ Graph Theory was hard. I'm not good enough at those subjects, nor did I really practice them enough over the course of a semester, to be able to flex that knowledge like it's a muscle. Because while other students were following along with the lectures, I was still years behind on the math and reasoning skills that underlie those subjects. </p>

			<p> So for a very long time now, I have felt like I existed in a world full of extremely well-qualified candidates who could do backflips around me in a whiteboard interview, and I'm starting to understand the reasons why. I'm also working my way upward in that direction, impressing myself at my performance in a recent technical interview with a company we can call TechCorp for the purposes of this post. </p>

		<h4> Part II: Pattern Recognition </h4>
			<p> Whether the interview question is a one-liner about technology X vs. Y, or an infamously fun brain teaser, the most helpful skill will be recognizing a pattern that you've seen before. </p>

			<p> A lot of problems in computer science involve lines of thinking that can be applied to a family of problems. One you understand recursion, you can apply it to a lot of things. Once you understand applying recursion to the Fibonacci problem, you can speak about the limits of it as a tool and alternatives such as memoization. And once you can do that, you can see other problems that would have similar limitations and apply the same thinking. Is it recursive, does it use the result of smaller recursive calls to get bigger answers, and is it exponentially expensive to re-compute every recursive call as n -> inf? Memoization. It seems really counterintuitive at first to memorize the properties of seemingly random problems in computer science, but the payoff comes when you start to see that a lot of these problems are a stand-in for a generic area of CS, and once you learn the concept, your brain will connect the rest of the dots. I wish somebody had told me that before I took Data Structures. </p>

		<h4> Part III: Critical Thinking </h4>
			<p> Another important aspect of being good at technical interviews is being good at reasoning about the problem. It may not always be the case that the question being asked of you is familiar, but it probably has some familiar pieces, and with some reasoning, you can find an answer. 

			<p>Critical thinking serves two roles here: </p>

			<ol>
				<li> To build an understanding of the foundational patterns/ problems that will be useful later on. This is how those cornerstone problems in CS (such as Fibonacci, O() complexity of algorithms, various problems in graph theory, synchronization mechanisms, et. al.) enter your brain and stay there for future reference. If you really learn these problems thoroughly, they will stick with you and come in handy later. But you have to be able to reason about them and really understand them for that to happen. </li>
				<li> To do the "twisting and turning" of what you already know and understand in order to arrive at the solution. This is the part where the professor solves the problem, and you ask them why, and they pull out a bunch of random theorems from other parts of math that show how they are correct. You would have never gotten there on your own, likely becuase you either never saw those patterns/ problems before, or because you didn't realize you could apply them to this particular problem. </li>
			</ol>


			<p>I think the second type of reasoning comes with a lot of practice in the same way that being good at math comes with practice. Sending me through my public school math and then asking me to reason about a math problem in college is like giving someone a lesson on walking in a straight line and then telling them the final exam requires ballroom dancing and a backflip. Sure, I understand most of the mechanics, but I never knew I would have to twist my brain into thinking about the material in that way; I just now learned it could even be done. But with a lot of practice and the help of various problems/ patterns, I've seen myself grow tremendously in this area and it's been really fulfilling to see.</p>

		<h4> Part IV: You (Maybe) Learned This As A Kid </h4>
			<p> You probably didn't learn all of Data Structures & Algorithms in K-12, but I wouldn't bet money on that based on the people I met in college CS. Still, you may have learned valuable math, logic, or debate skills that come in handy later on in life. I think this is probably especially true of anyone who was really into math programs, but it could also be true of students in certain other extracurriculars. It certainly could be true of more students if their curriculum was redesigned. </p> 

			<p> This is definitely a much larger topic than I can cover right now, but I don't like the way math was taught to me as a kid. It was unbearably slow, taught completely by rote, and peppered with random topics that made no sense in the context of when they were taught. I actually had a very good education when it came to verbal skills. I believe that has gotten me very, very far as an adult and I am so grateful for the literacy programs my public school had. But when I think back on it, were these not pretty similar to the math lessons? Sure, some of my teachers had a bias for reading over other subjects, but I don't know if that's the whole story. Reading/ literacy is a skill I learned by long and daunting practice. I would read for long stretches of time in and out of the classroom, participate in summer reading programs at the library, and write stories for fun. In school we would have quiet reading hour, we would get independent time to read from a special box of stories and test our learning after with a self-administered quiz, and we would get lessons on things like homophones. All pretty rote and autonomous activities for a 7 year old child. Yet these lessons propelled me forward for the rest of my life, and even 10+ years later when I took the SAT, my verbal skills were better than my math skills. I believe these skills made me a better note-taker and a better learner in the lecture/classroom/textbook/essay environment. In contrast, we didn't spend so much time on math. Sure, we had lessons on the chalkboard about how to do arithmetic, we talked about different ways to do the arithmetic and a bit of the underlying math, and we practiced with worksheets in-class. But it wasn't as engaging, it didn't feel as important, and for me, it was so boring. The only rewarding thing about doing math in school was memorizing the steps and getting an A on the test. Engaging with reading and writing felt so natural, and math felt so foreign. There's always the possibility that my brain is just wired for verbal skills more than non-verbal, but I do wonder if I had the parallel experience but with math if I would be one of those Perfect Technical Interview Candidates by now. </p>

			<p> And sure, a lot of that last paragraph I just wrote could be brushed off as entirely anecdotal and biased toward a certain worldview. Maybe I really was just born with a reading brain and I got lucky because my early education was taught by reading teachers. I'm also pretty good at languages, for what that says about my brain. But there's some evidence here that might back me up: John McWhorter says that learning to read by phonics proves the most effective for students of all backgrounds, which is especially good news for children of lower income backgrounds who might not have the huge library at home that could support them in other types of self-directed learning that some school districts try out. Phonics works. It's what worked for me. It's how my dad taught me to say "cat" with fridge magnets (thanks dad!), and I should really call him to tell him he nailed it. It's still how I engage with language, how I have always been pretty good at spelling, how I pick up new languages fast, how I am (at turtle speed) trying to get the basics of Hebrew down. So I do believe there is something about repetition and practice that builds up their verbal skills in your brain. First and second grade were like verbal skills boot camp in this regard, and I attribute a lot of my abilities to that. </p>

			<p> But I don't think math works that way. Because my teachers tended to take a similar approach to teaching math, and it worked in so far as my ability to memorize the steps required to do multiplication on paper. And while we didn't spend nearly as much time in those early elementary years doing math as we did reading, we did learn in similar ways, by watching the teacher do it on the board and then repeating the mechanical steps on a worksheet. We would occasionally try something new, like using blocks to understand counting. But the reasoning required to really understand math just never arose from these activities. Math requires an entirely different way of learning, involving pattern recognition and those "twisting and turning" reasoning skills that pass tech interviews. If you don't believe me, pick up a copy of The Art of Problem Solving, do a few chapters, and report back. </p>

		<h4> Part V: The Social Aspect </h4>
			<p>So the last thing I’ll say about a technical interview is that you (usually) also need to be likable and good at communicating. These are also skills you build up over time, but in a different way. You have to be able to explain your thinking and build rapport with your interviewer. It also helps to have a bit of humor and warmness to you, so you don’t look like a robot whose sole purpose is passing a technical interview. This is really for you to be able to gauge the person interviewing you — are they a robot? Are they going to treat you like a human? Can they have some humor and warmness? These are important things to look out for, because it’s really difficult to judge your potential new coworkers as coworkers in the power dynamic that an interview creates. </p>

			<p> A lot more can be said for other skills that do not shine through in a technical interview. I think a lot of the ways in which I am really smart are hidden by tech interviews, just like they were hidden in college. I'm still a good software engineer, and I am learning these technical interview skills as I go along. Interviewers should certainly be looking for other cues as to candidates' abilities: problem solving, collaboration, communication to name a few. So hopefully a technical interview is just one piece of the puzzle, and the other pieces are what really will make up the bigger picture in the way of matching a candidate to a position. I know I certainly wouldn't work for a company that didn't make an effort to gague me on other qualities, because I don't want to work with colleagues who were hired solely for their ability to ace the whiteboard. </p>

		<h4> Bonus, Part VI: An Interview With TechCorp </h4>
			<p> So like I said at the beginning of this post, I recently had an interview with a company we can call TechCorp. This was a technical screening. The interviewer and I had a bit of chit chat, talked about the role, and then went into ~10 technical questions. These questions were a mix of "are you familiar with X fundamental of CS" and "can you use some fundamentals combined and reason your way to an answer". 100% of these questions could have been answered in the "pattern" method, described above, if I had seen them before. I think I had seen probably 80% of them directly and I reasoned my way through the other 20% based on other patterns I had picked up on in college. </p>

			<p> The patterns part is so, so important. The patterns really build on each other, and seeing them cascade from "I have answered this exact problem before" to "I have seen X before, I have seen Y before, and I can twist and turn my way to get to Z" was really fulfilling for me. It showed me that I learned a lot in college and that I haven't stopped learning since. It also proved that these skills are learned, and that I'm not stupid because I wouldn't have done as well on this interview 5 years ago. I have grown a lot, and I'm so glad I never gave up on these skills. </p>


<h3> 8 August 2020: Some thoughts on generalizing vs. specializing </h3>
	<p> The more time you spend with technology, the more you realize it would be difficult to even define what a technologist does. Our jobs, even jobs we hold at different points in time, are so vasty different from each other. I guess some commonalities might include: </p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Things-with-circuit-boards-adjacent (but not necessarily so)</b> </li>
		<li><b>We talk to computers in computer language </b> (depends on your opinion of high level languages, compilers, interpreters, and how close to "computer language" one really is at any given time; certain positions require no programming)</li>
  		<li>People who <b> work with logic </b>(common in other fields if you use the philosophical definition; omnipresent if you just mean "reasoning")</li>
  		<li>We maintain and/or build hardware and/or software and/or processes and/or models in order to provide a good or service to our consumers, or to integrate the aforementioned systems with each other, or to understand something about the world in a way that requires mathematics and/or logical reasoning. (I don't think I'm getting any closer to a good definition.)</li>
  	</ul>

	<p> Anyway, I think my point is that you can do many different jobs and still be considered a technical person. There are also countless non-technical or somewhat-technical positions in the field. When you get a computer science degree, the many possibilities are exciting and overwhelming. My college split up the areas into several areas such as machine learning &amp; AI, applications, systems (hello), theory, and probably a few others. Which implies that somebody studying computer science could possibly branch off into any of these areas, which each have their own subspecialties. So when you get into the job market, you have to make your best guess at which jobs you're qualified for and interested in. </p>

	<p> Which brings me to my next point, which is that hiring for technical jobs is strange. </p>

	<p> New grad hiring isn't so bad; employers typically don't expect much aside from the typical CS stuff that students are supposed to know out of college. Some places require intense whiteboarding interviews that test some amorphous combination of CS and mathematical reasoning. (By that I mean that some quesitons are answerable using only a rote learning of something in CS, some are answerable using math thinking skills only, but most requre some of both.) So in that sense, hiring right out of school, especially for large corporations, tends to be very generic. They probably require their candidates to have some interest (and/or internship experience) in the industry that the company operates in. But nobody is expecting an expert in some niche area of technology. </p>

	<p> Some companies continue to hire generic technologists/ developers even after their candidates have had industry experience. Some believe that, as long as a candidate is intelligent (+ a bunch of other qualities) and possesses some degree of experience in the field, the candidate will be successful and potentially a better fit than someone with the specialty or experience but with less general problem-solving skills. </p>

	<p> I feel conflicted on this one. I'm more inclined to agree with the generic hiring because I think it's better for companies and candidates, but I can appreciate that it would be very hard to hire a brilliant person with no dev experience for a senior software engineer job. There's room for a spectrum there -- hiring for some skills and some general problem solving abilities -- which I think is the right way to go. Still, on that spectrum, I would lean toward generic "good at learning and happy to be here" rather than "expert at niche thing" in most cases. </p>

	<p> This style of hiring is better for employees as people. LIfe is short but careers are long -- people should be allowed to try new things and explore new paths. This isn't possible if everybody is only hiring experts. Happy and curious employees are better employees. </p>

<h3> 8 August 2020: I don't believe in dream interpretation (mostly) </h3>

	<p> For the past few weeks I've been doing a lot of technical review as I begin interviewing again. I have almost no experience with technical interviews in the typical "whiteboarding" sense, so I spent last Saturday reading through some data structures and algorithms stuff. I also reminded myself of everything on my resume and looked through old code. It was an interesting look back at what I used to be able to do in college -- I am impressed that I knew all of that at the same time. I guess my skills are getting rusty, which tends to happen when you're at one job for a long time. And then a few nights ago, I had a dream about code, which hasn't happened to me in a very long time. </p>

	<p> So when I say I don't believe in dream interpretation, I mean that I don't look for too much meaning in my dreams beyond what I think they themselves are telling me in the context of my own life. But I do think there are some interesting things that happen in the brain when we write code or do any other task in an all-consuming way. And I think one of the effects of the all-consuming nature of writing code is that I get dreams about the code. One of my good friends also used to get coding dreams when we were in college. Sometimes she and I would even have breakthroughs about our projects while we slept. </p>


	<p> I'm positive we're not the only ones with this feature (if you will). I had a college professor who implored my class to read his assignments the day they were published, even if we didn't plan to do them until the day before they were due (he knew...). He said the assignments needed to "cook" inside our brains for a little while, even if we weren't actively working on them. So if we would just read the assignment, we could start formulating a solution before we wrote any code. </p>

	<p> I think that professor had pretty good advice. I think I do subconsciously "cook" my problems and I especially do that while I'm asleep. A code base turns into a visual space for me, where I can walk around in my dreams and if nothing else, get even more familiar with the flow of a program. This doesn't happen all the time, and I don't remember it happening to me much after I began working full time. </p>

	<p> So I don't think my dream was trying to tell me anything, but I do think the fact that it happened tells me something about how I've been using my brain since starting at work full-time. What I think that says about my current situation is that I'm either not deep enough in the various systems I'm working with to be able to spatially model them, or I'm not familiar enough with what an abstraction would even look like if I tried, or I'm not interested enough in the particular technologies to give up space in my dreams. It's possibly a combination of all 3 of those things. </p>

<h3> 9 March 2020 Complaint Hour: When nobody is as worried as you are </h3>
	<p> I'll attach a disclaimer here: I am not an authority or expert on diseases, public health, medicine or epidemiology. My (lone) degree is in computer science. But just like everyone else, I have some opinions and a lot of fears about the current global health situation. </p>

	<p> All of last week, I felt like I was shouting into the void. </p>

	<p>I was too scared to go to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I forced myself to go on Tuesday and Thursday. Frankly, that was probably kind of stupid, and I should have stayed home all week, especially after somebody in my management chain gave us the verbal OK to stay home. But I was worried that I was overreacting, and everyone thought I was being crazy, so I dragged my nervous, tired self into the office. </p>

	<p> Part of the reason it was so hard for me to go into work on those days was because I had been up the night before reading about the coronavirus. What happens when you're the only one around you who seems to take it seriously? </p>

	<p> Then my employer started full WFH, as did the employers of my friends and family, and then life as we knew it started to shift. Finally other people were taking it seriously so it was time for us to follow suit. </p>

	<p> I don't understand the compulsive need for nothing to interrupt our precious lives as we know them, even temporarily, in small ways, in order to prevent big irreversible changes down the road. Is it really that difficult to wash your fucking hands before you eat? To be conscious of the things you're touching? I know that staying home isn't a viable economic option for many people, not to mention the essential services we rely on that can only continue if some people still go into work. Could we have prevented this degree of spread by being a little more cautious? </p>

	<p> So we find ourselves in a debt not unlike technical debt, if I may borrow an analogy on something I really *am* qualified to speak on (which is technology). In software engineering, there's a concept of technical debt and the cost of changes as the project nears completion. I'm sure this analogy is true in many domains, but specifically in software engineering, we know that it costs exponentially more to make changes to the software as more software gets built. Since software builds on itself, we can think of it like a house. Sure, it would cost us a lot to re-do the foundation right after we just spent a bunch of time and money on it. But it would cost exponentially more if we needed to change it once the rest of the house was already built on top of it. In software if you need to make a sweeping change, it's cheapest to do it as early as possible, even if it looks bad and costs you some up front costs. </p>

	<p> Like I said, I'm not an expert on health, disease, medicine, etc. I'm just a software engineer. But I do think the overall cost of quarantines, travel restrictions and public health campaigns would have been *way* cheaper last month than they will be this month. </p>

	<p> Which brings me to the real reason I wrote this post: because I don't think people are taking things seriously enough. To be fair, taking things too seriously has a cost too. But the world's "wait and see" mentality is really only a good strategy in normal times. We are not living in normal times. "Wait and see" is a good strategy for a lot of things. It's how the world has masterfully navigated many things. But we did our share of waiting and seeing on this virus, and we should have seen that it's time to act. </p>

<h3> 2 March 2020 Complaint Hour: WASH YOUR HANDS </h3>

<h3> 28 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Allergies </h3>
	<p> It's just pollen and dust mites!!!! </p>

	<p> The only things that work for me are these enormous over the counter antihistamines and this awful nasal spray. I mean I would be in bad shape without them, and I'm glad I know how to handle allergies (sort of) but I really resent the way I was perfectly fine for the first X years of my life and suddenly I woke up one day allergic to the environment!!! </p>

	<p> I should go to an allergist. </p>

<h3>  27 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Recruitment Culture* </h3>
	<p> <i> *I don't know what else to call it, so let's go with "recruitment culture" for now. </i></p>

	<p>There is a toxic culture in the tech industry around job hunting, recruiting and self-promotion. This is today's Complaint Hour. </p>

	<p> Across many platforms, the most toxic fusion of resume writing and social media promoting have come together to make job hunting a nightmare. Regular people you knew from college are suddenly "Tech Moguls" with "Extensive Industry Knowledge" of really obscure but somehow all-buzzword niches. Everyone is a "motivated, goal-oriented, passionate" thinker. No wonder so many job postings are asking for rockstars and subject matter experts across so many different technologies. Are there people on these websites who are incredibly talented, passionate and actual experts? Of course! But I think it can be hard for people to admit to the world that they're not actually experts in every technology out there. </p>

	<p> But complainthour, you might ask me, other than the love of complaining, why do you care so much about this? I care about this because it makes it so hard to be honest. Have you ever sat down and really taken an honest inventory of your skill set? I'd bet you are an expert at some things, intermediately skilled at many other things, and a beginner at a lot of other things. It's good to be T-shaped -- broad in most subjects and deep in a few. That's normal. I wish we could all admit that we're T-shaped.</p>

	<p> But what about all of these job postings that say I need to know every technology under the sun? These are a big part of the problem. There are very few people on this earth who I truly believe can be fully qualified for some of the job postings I've seen. Some of them are unrealistically specific, expecting you to have learned every technology in their in-house stack. I think it's more important to hire people who have a solid foundation of knowledge and who are quick learners. Isn't it better for your organization to hire smart people with a hunger to learn your tech stack? Wouldn't you rather have honest candidates who fulfill 50% of your desired qualifications but who are really genuinely excited to come contribute to your organization with the skills they do have? </p>

	<p> My point here is that I really hate to see the way career building has become a contest of who can embellish their accomplishments most. I think it's great when people can celebrate their achievements and showcase the skills they've worked hard to build. I personally feel great about showing off the work I've done to get where I am in my career. But I also hate the pressure to know everything, to have learned every new technology and to label ourselves as these businessy caricatures of ourselves for the sake of career growth. </p>
