 <h3> 1 August 2020 Complaint Hour: Checking In as we Approach Day #150 of Permanent WFH </h3>
<p> I had written a post about this in March, but it was pretty unpolished so I had let it sit. I went back and made some minor edits, and I thought I'd publish it and respond to it now that we're nearly half a year into the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<ul>
<li> Still just a software engineer with no medical or public health background. </li>
<li> Many of us are still just shouting into the void. </li>
<li> Those first days of March didn't seem to have a negative impact on me, thankfully, and I started safely working from home full time the following week. </li>
<li> A lot has happened. There are still many things about this virus that are unknown, incluing who it affects in which ways. We know that people with certain preexisting conditions are at higher risk for serious cases. Those fears were not unfounded. My perspective on this is roughly: New York City was the first major city to enact a near-complete lockdown. Essential workers (medical professionals, food service employees, grocery store employees, etc.) still went into work, but the rest of us were required to stay home. It was unclear whether masks were helpful since there was some misinformation circulating in the beginning of the pandemic in an effort to preserve PPE for medical workers by convincing the general public not to buy it. Ventilators were the last resort for many people with respiratory failure, but New York did not have enough to sustain mass infections. A Navy hospital ship was docked in the Hudson River to provide additional hospital beds. The Javits Center was turned into an extra hospital by the military. A small hospital was built in tents in Central Park. The food supply chain was interrupted by panic purchaces and a shift to 100% at-home life. Groceries were hard to get without risking exposure in a grocery store. New York settled down as the weeks went on and we managed to get infection rates under control. It became clear that life under COVID would be more than a few weeks of social distancing (defined rougly: no gatherings of people from different households, unless outdoors with at least 6ft of distance and all parties wearing masks). It would be months of working from home, restaurants closed for indoor dining, schools closed, events cancelled. Slowly New York and the tristate area began reopening in phases, with some rolled back as infection rates rose again. New York would become the poster child for how to manage the pandemic while infections soared in other states. There would come to be COVID deniers who either brushed off the virus as unharmful, refused to wear masks because they believed it was an infringement on their rights, or who believed that the pandemic was entirely made up. This is where we currently find ourselves. We don't need all those extra hospital beds. We are managing. But the schools are still closed, we still wear masks outside the home, work is still remote for the foreseeable (and I mean, like, if you can foresee another 365 days) future. Life has eased up a bit as everyone has adapted. But this shit got absolutely crazy. For a while, life in the tristate was pretty scary. We got through it. We are still getting through it. And I am still shouting into the void to mask up, wash your hands, and contribute to controlling this pandemic. </li> 
<li> Still WFH. 100% WFH is very nice without the commute or open office plan. I recognize how lucky I am to be in this position, and I think the world should allow for more remote work where possible. It's much easier on me as a human being. </li>

<li> Yes, probably, if we as a nation would have taken the precautions much more seriously at the beginning. This has gotten so incredibly expensive.</li>

<li> Worse than a debt, we are struggling to even contain the spread in some areas. </li>


</ul>
I know this post sounds pretty grim. Things were very scary in March and April, but life slowly adjusted. Things in New York are actually looking pretty good as we enter the later phases of reopening. In retrospect, a lot more should have been done in the beginning. 

  <h3> 9 March 2020 Complaint Hour: When nobody is as worried as you are </h3>
  <p> I'll attach a disclaimer here: I am not an authority or expert on diseases, public health, medicine or epidemiology. My (lone) degree is in computer science. But just like everyone else, I have some opinions and a lot of fears about the current global health situation. </p>

  <p> All of last week, I felt like I was shouting into the void. </p>
  <p> I was too scared to go to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I forced myself to go on Tuesday and Thursday. Frankly, that was probably kind of stupid, and I should have stayed home all week, especially after somebody in my management chain gave us the verbal OK to stay home. But I was worried that I was overreacting, and everyone thought I was being crazy, so I dragged my nervous, tired self into the office. </p> 

  <p> Part of the reason it was so hard for me to go into work on those days was because I had been up the night before reading about the coronavirus. For the "young" and "healthy" there is probably nothing to worry about, but what happens when that's not the case for you? What happens when you aren't so carefree? What happens when you're the only one around you who seems to take it seriously?</p> 

  <p> Then my employer started full WFH, as did the employers of my friends and family, and then life as we knew it started to shift. Finally other people were taking it seriously so it was time for us to follow suit. </p> 

  <p> I don't understand the compulsive need for nothing to interrupt our precious lives as we know them, even temporarily, in small ways, in order to prevent big irreversible changes down the road. Is it really that difficult to wash your fucking hands before you eat? To be conscious of the things you're touching? I know that staying home isn't a viable economic option for many people, not to mention the essential services we rely on that can only continue if some people still go into work. Could we have prevented this degree of spread by being a little more cautious?<p>

  <p> So we find ourselves in a debt not unlike technical debt, if I may borrow an analogy on something I really *am* qualified to speak on (which is technology). In software engineering, there's a concept of technical debt and the cost of changes as the project nears completion. I'm sure this analogy is true in many domains, but specifically in software engineering, we know that it costs exponentially more to make changes to the software as more software gets built. Since software builds on itself, we can think of it like a house. Sure, it would cost us a lot to re-do the foundation right after we just spent a bunch of time and money on it. But it would cost exponentially more if we needed to change it once the rest of the house was already built on top of it. In software if you need to make a sweeping change, it's cheapest to do it as early as possible, even if it looks bad and costs you some up front costs. </p> 

  <p> Like I said, I'm not an expert on health, disease, medicine, etc. I'm just a software engineer. But I do think the overall cost of quarantines, travel restrictions and public health campaigns would have been *way* cheaper last month than they will be this month. </p>

  <p> Which brings me to the real reason I wrote this post: because I don't think people are taking things seriously enough. To be fair, taking things too seriously has a cost too. But the world's "wait and see" mentality is really only a good strategy in normal times. We are not living in normal times. "Wait and see" is a good strategy for a lot of things. It's how the world has masterfully navigated many things. But we did our share of waiting and seeing on this virus, and we should have seen that it's time to act. 

  <h3> 2 March 2020 Complaint Hour: WASH YOUR HANDS </h3>


  <h3> 28 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Allergies </h3>
  <p>  It's just pollen and dust mites!!!!</p> 
  <p> The only things that work for me are these enormous over the counter antihistamines and this awful nasal spray. I mean I would be in bad shape without them, and I'm glad I know how to handle allergies (sort of) but I really resent the way I was perfectly fine for the first X years of my life and suddenly I woke up one day allergic to the environment!!! </p> 
  <p> I should go to an allergist. </p> 

  <h3> 27 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Recruitment Culture* </h3> 
   <p> *I don't know what else to call it, so let's go with "recruitment culture" for now. </p>
  <p> There is a toxic culture in the tech industry around job hunting, recruiting and self-promotion. This is today's Complaint Hour. </p>

  <p> Across many platforms, the most toxic fusion of resume writing and social media promoting have come together to make job hunting a nightmare. Regular people you knew from college are suddenly "Tech Moguls" with "Extensive Industry Knowledge" of really obscure but somehow all-buzzword niches. Everyone is a "motivated, goal-oriented, passionate" thinker. No wonder so many job postings are asking for rockstars and subject matter experts across so many different technologies. Are there people on these websites who are incredibly talented, passionate and actual experts? Of course! But I think it can be hard for people to admit to the world that they're not actually experts in every technology out there. </p> 

  <p> <i>But complainthour, you might ask me, other than the love of complaining, why do you care so much about this?</i> I care about this because it makes it so hard to be honest. Have you ever sat down and really taken an honest inventory of your skill set? I'd bet you are an expert at some things, intermediately skilled at many other things, and a beginner at a lot of other things. It's good to be T-shaped -- broad in most subjects and deep in a few. That's normal. I wish we could all admit that we're T-shaped. </p> 

  <p> <i>But what about all of these job postings that say I need to know every technology under the sun?</i> These are a big part of the problem. There are very few people on this earth who I truly believe can be fully qualified for some of the job postings I've seen. Some of them are unrealistically specific, expecting you to have learned every technology in their in-house stack. I think it's more important to hire people who have a solid foundation of knowledge and who are quick learners. Isn't it better for your organization to hire smart people with a hunger to learn your tech stack? Wouldn't you rather have honest candidates who fulfill 50% of your desired qualifications but who are really genuinely excited to come contribute to your organization with the skills they do have?</p>   

  <p> My point here is that I really hate to see the way career building has become a contest of who can embellish their accomplishments most. I think it's great when people can celebrate their achievements and showcase the skills they've worked hard to build. I personally feel great about showing off the work I've done to get where I am in my career. But I also hate the pressure to know everything, to have learned every new technology and to label ourselves as these businessy caricatures of ourselves for the sake of career growth. </p>
