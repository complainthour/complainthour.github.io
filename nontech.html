  <h3> 28 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Allergies </h3>
  <p> It's like my immune system has anxiety. It's just pollen and dust mites!!!!</p> 
  <p> The only things that work for me are these enormous over the counter antihistamines and this awful nasal spray. I mean I would be in bad shape without them, and I'm glad I know how to handle allergies (sort of) but I really resent the way I was perfectly fine for the first X years of my life and suddenly I woke up one day allergic to the environment!!! </p> 
  <p> I should go to an allergist. </p> 

  <h3> 27 February 2020 Complaint Hour: Recruitment Culture* </h3> 
  <p> *I don't know what else to call it, so let's go with "recruitment culture" for now. </p>
  <p> There is a toxic culture in the tech industry around job hunting, recruiting and self-promotion. This is today's Complaint Hour. </p>

  <p> Across many platforms, the most toxic fusion of resume writing and social media promoting have come together to make job hunting a nightmare. Regular people you knew from college are suddenly "Tech Moguls" with "Extensive Industry Knowledge" of really obscure but somehow all-buzzword niches. Everyone is a "motivated, goal-oriented, passionate" thinker. No wonder so many job postings are asking for rockstars and subject matter experts across so many different technologies. Are there people on these websites who are incredibly talented, passionate and actual experts? Of course! But I think it can be hard for people to admit to the world that they're not actually experts in every technology out there. </p> 

  <p> <i>But complainthour, you might ask me, other than the love of complaining, why do you care so much about this?</i> I care about this because it makes it so hard to be honest. Have you ever sat down and really taken an honest inventory of your skill set? I'd bet you are an expert at some things, intermediately skilled at many other things, and a beginner at a lot of other things. It's good to be T-shaped -- broad in most subjects and deep in a few. That's normal. I wish we could all admit that we're T-shaped. </p> 

  <p> <i>But what about all of these job postings that say I need to know every technology under the sun?</i> These are a big part of the problem. There are very few people on this earth who I truly believe can be fully qualified for some of the job postings I've seen. Some of them are unrealistically specific, expecting you to have learned every technology in their in-house stack. I think it's more important to hire people who have a solid foundation of knowledge and who are quick learners. Isn't it better for your organization to hire smart people with a hunger to learn your tech stack? Wouldn't you rather have honest candidates who fulfill 50% of your desired qualifications but who are really genuinely excited to come contribute to your organization with the skills they do have?</p>   

  <p> My point here is that I really hate to see the way career building has become a contest of who can embellish their accomplishments most. I think it's great when people can celebrate their achievements and showcase the skills they've worked hard to build. I personally feel great about showing off the work I've done to get where I am in my career. But I also hate the pressure to know everything, to have learned every new technology and to label ourselves as these businessy caricatures of ourselves for the sake of career growth. </p>

  <p> Thanks for coming to my first Complaint Hour. </p>
