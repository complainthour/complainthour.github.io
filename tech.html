<h3> 8 August 2020: MongoDB </h3>

<p> Thanks to watching that video (see post below) about NoSQL databases, I decided to get familiar (re-familiar?) with MongoDB. I have been adjacent to MongoDB before (it was part of a project I worked on) but I want to get more hands-on. </p>

<p> It starts with installing MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).</p>

<p> </p>



<h3> <b> 4 Aug 2020 </b> A brief interlude: NoSQL Databases </h3>
<p> Notes from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I"> Introduction to NoSQL, Martin Fowler </a>
<p> Problem: Object-relational impedance mismatch (Things are logically organized into objects in code, but those objects have to be split up and stored into tables and mapped by schema.) Hence ORMs. </p>
<p> SQL is designed to run on large servers, not large grids of small hardware which became dominant as large internet companies grew in the 2000s. </p>
<p> Thus Bigtable & Dynamo </p>
<p> NoSQL is hard to define, but it's generally non-relational, cluster-friendly, schema-less, open source. </p>
<p> There are four general categories of NoSQL: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Column-family. Examples: Bigtable  </li>
  <li> Graph. (Node and edge graph model. Good at moving across relationships between things (wherease in relational, you need foreign keys, joins.) Interesting query language for navigating graphs. )Examples: Neo4j </li>
  <li> Document (Typically stored as JSON. You can query into the document structure. An attribute is kind of like a key...) Examples: MongoDB, Dynamo</li>
  <li> Key-value (Like a persistent hashmap. You can usually store metadata about the records, though, so this becomes more like a document database.). Examples: </li>
</ol>

<p> Martin Fowler calls Document, Key-Value and Column-family "Aggregate-Oriented" databases. </p>

<p> Though NoSQL is schema-less, there is an implicit schema in NoSQL dbs that becomes clear when you start querying! For example, querying MongoDB for a particular JSON attribute. </p>

<p> Big advantage of aggregate-oriented is that you can store multiple pieces of information together in a single record, whereas in a relational db, you would need to have two tables and map one row from a table to multiple rows of another table in order to associate the information correctly. </p>

<p> Aggregation makes clustering easy because you know what will need to be stored close together. </p> 

<p> Column-family is also aggregate-oriented. </p>

<p> Aggregation has a drawback: really difficult to slice and dice your data after you've decided on the aggregation. </p>

<p> So how do the different NoSQL models handle relationships? Aggregate-oriented databases are similar to relational dbs, in that you have to associate by attributes or values in the data. Graph databases are oriented toward relationships since they are node-edge models. This is good guide for deciding which db to use. </p>

<p> Consistency in NoSQL: SQL=ACID, NoSQL=BASE. But Martin Fowler isn't a fan of this. Graph db's are ACID. Aggregate-oriented databases don't need ACID quite as much. Aggregations are transaction boundaries! So you shouldn't really need to lock more than one aggregation at a time. If you update multiple documents at a time in document dbs, then you need additional atomicity.</p>

<p> In general, transactions are achieved by letting a user retrieve a versioned record, updating that versioned record, and sending it back. Then when two users have written at the same time to their own copy of the version, you can do whatever conflict resolution you need to. </p>

<p> Logical consistency vs. replication consistency </p>

<p> What if two nodes lose communication with each other? Do you allow both to modify the same object, or neither? This is a tradeoff between consistency and availability. Dynamo needed to guarantee availability in the shopping cart for Amazon. </p>

<p> CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, PartitionTolerance. Pick 2. (aka, if you get a network partition (communication failure between nodes), you can either have availability or consistency.) But this is on a spectrum, so it's not always just one or the other. Even if the network is up, you have a performance tradeoff if you want to be 100% consistent since it takes time to absolutely guarantee consistency across nodes. So it's a safety vs. liveness in concurrency issue. </p>

<p> So when to use a NoSQL database? Two drivers: 1. Large amounts of data that can't fit well into a relational database. 2. Natural aggregates, for example when publishing news stories that have metadata and content together. Another reason includes analytics, as an alternative to datawarehousing. </p> 

<h3> <b> 3 Aug 2020 </b> DigitalOcean Databases </h3>
<p> Just some notes as I try out DigitalOcean's database-as-a-service platform. </p>

<p> General observations: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Pricing is pretty up-front</li>
  <li> They give you a lot of nice little security hints -- allow/deny IPs, use 2FA, put your recovery codes in an encrypted file or pw manager, only showing OAuth token once ever </li>
  <li> Instantly I'm noticing a lack of integrations with any identity platform on the database (but this is a hard problem) </li>
  <li> I can see that the randomly generated database admin pw is pretty strong and can be rotated manually -- auto rotations maybe?</li>
</ul>

<p> What I'm doing: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Created my DO account </li>
  <li> Created new Postgres 12 db </li>
  <li> Did some initial configs on it (IP allow listing) </li>
  <li> <i> brew install postgres </i> because my college MacBook, where I did all of my college db work, is asleep </li>
  <li> Connect to my new db from the psql client. Pretty smooth; basically what I would expect. </li>
  <li> Found a dataset on Kaggle in CSV format, created a table for it in the db, used \copy command in psql to copy the data in. Now I can query Netflix titles! </li>
  <li> Generated OAuth API Bearer Token and used it to list my database clusters via HTTPS request (note: not immediately clear to me here that I would need to list all clusters first, then get the cluster id, then get more specific details from it. Wish cluster id was avialable on UI.)</li>
</ol>

<p> Questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li> What's this .crt file it generated for me? It says it relates to my specific project (unit of organization for DO resources). Is
it to allow my workstation to trust my project? So it's a server certificate? (Is this for machine-to-machine auth when you use other DO resources?)</li>
</ul>


 <h3> <b> 1 Aug 2020 </b> Checking in on my 2020 goals </h3>
<p> Wow, it has been a while! As the COVID-19 pandemic completely took over life as we knew it in 2020, I was making sporadic progress on the goals I outlined above. I also have some more clarity on what I'm wanting looking into the future career-wise. So without further adieu, here's what I've been working on: </p>


  <ul>
    <li> <b> Configuration management (probably Ansible): </b> A while back, I played around with Ansible on AWS as a way to spin up and configure some EC2 instances.  </li>
    <li> <b> Containers: </b> I did put some time into this one! I got Docker Desktop set up at home and just poked around for a bit with the Flask image and said "hello, world!" from Docker. I also tried out a security product that's distributed as a Docker image. I took a self-paced course on containers and I generally understand the basics now. I know why you'd use one over a VM, where to get images, what a Dockerfile is, how to spin up a container, how to map ports & storage, and how to set up a little environment with multiple containers that communicate with one another (network). Next on my list for this one is: orchestration/k8s. </li>
    <li> <b> (improve) Software design for testability: </b> Are we ever really done with this one? :) Again, nothing really specific here, but I haven't stopped writing tests!</li> 
    <li> <b> API design: </b> Nope. </li> 
    <li> <b> Functions-as-a-Service: (probably AWS Lambda) </b> I did play with this one! See blog posts above. But nothing groundbreaking. </li>
  </ul> 

  <p> So I guess I've been working on less than I thought?! But I have been busy. At work I have the typical workload (+, you know, the pandemic).</p> 

<p> I've also been working on brushing up on SQL and concurrency. I apparently remember a lot about spin locks and not a lot else (probably beacuse I haven't done much of it outside of college OS class). </p>

  <h3> 1 March 2020 Lambdas! </h3> 
  <p> Today I was wandering around my little AWS playground and I was kind of bored by what I was doing (messing with flask and security groups) so I decided to see if I could get a Lambda up and running. Some days I love following tutorials and absorbing every word. Other days, I want to just break things and see how far I can get. Today was one of those days. </p>
  <p> So what is a Lambda? It's a function-as-a-service. You give AWS some code to run and it figures out the rest for you. How's that different from running code on EC2 or in a container? Well, it's even easier. There's no infrastructure, OS, or even runtime to worry about. You give AWS the code -- literally the source code -- and it takes care of the rest. </p>
  <p> Well you do have to give it a trigger. Otherwise it would just be code that AWS doesn't know when to run. </p> 
  <p> Here are (roughly) the steps with commentary, for doing what I did today: </p
  <ol>
    <li> In the AWS Console, open Lambdas and Create Function</li>
    <li> Author from scratch (it's more fun this way...?) </li>
    <li> Choose a runtime you like (Python here) </li>
    <li> Permissions: Create new with basic Lambda permissions </li>
    <li> Add trigger: API Gateway (trigger this function on an API call) </li> 
    <li> Create new REST API; Open with API Key </li> 
  </ol>

  <p> So at this point I ostensibly have my own API Gateway backed by a lambda function. But how do I use it? On the function's Configuration tab, there's a Designer diagram. Click the API Gateway icon. It will show some configurations, including the API endpoint. So open up a new tab and try it out! </p>
  <p> Well, you'll find that it doesn't work. You get a nice little {"message":"Forbidden"} response from your own API because you set the authorizations to Open with API Key but you didn't provide a key! </p>
  <p> Get the key from the AWS Console's API Gateway service and navigating to API Keys. The API Gateway page is also where you can disable API Keys or enable IAM authorizations for your APIs. </p>
  <p> One way to provide the API key to the endpoint is in the headers as an x-api-key. You'll notice that <code> curl $ApiEndpoint </code> gives you back the same forbidden response, while <code> curl -i -H "x-api-key: $Key" $Endpoint </code> invokes your Lambda! </p>
  <p> At this point your Lambda will execute the boilerplate Hello World python code that gets populated when you create a python Lambda but you can edit it to do whatever you want! </p>

  <h3> <b> 27 Feb 2020 </b> On Writing Good Unit Tests </h3>
  <p> I still remember the day I learned about automated testing. I was in my junior fall semester of college, taking a class about software engineering. All of my other classes up to that point had been very "CS"-y and not very, well, "practical." This particular class required a semester-long software engineering project with CI/CD, testing and (somewhat humorously) UML diagrams. A guest lecturer pulled my group to the side and asked us if we knew how to write a test. And thus the magic of Assert() was revealed to me. Today as a software engineer, I pride myself on the quality of my tests and the efficiency of my CI/CD pipeline. I don't consider a feature "done" unless there are tests. I will not tell you my code is "ready" if I didn't push the play button and wait for a versioned, tested executable to come out of the other end of the pipeline. I definitely think these are some of my strenghts as a software engineer but there are also some things that I'd still like to improve on in this area. </p> 

   <p> It's kind of hard to definitively say what a "good" test is but there are some easy ways to identify bad ones. So we can start there. Bad things to do in tests: </p>
   <ul>
    <li> Depend on other tests </li>
    <li> Depend on external factors that can change, such as databases or web services</li>
    <li> Only test the positive cases </li>
    <li> Stop writing tests after the initial development (if you find an edge case later, fix it and write a test!) </li> 
  </ul>

   <p> Here are my tips for good testing (but this is by no means comprehensive!): </p>
   <ul>
    <li> Think about equivalence classes & consider some (reasonable) ones </li
    <li> Fuzz it (aka throw absolute nonsense inputs at it). This one makes more sense if you have user-facing surfaces, but can be useful if you use a data source that could one day feed your program garbage. </li> 
    <li> Consider testing in your initial design (my current favorite framework for this is dependency injection) </li> 
    <li> Write a lot of small tests (hence the name "unit") but also consider some end-to-end tests to make sure your program executes in the way you think it does once it's all put together. I've caught some <b> nasty </b> bugs this way. </li> 
  </ul> 

  <p> Of course there are still things that mystify me about testing. Here are some of those things: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Exactly which methods should I unit test? Only the external-facing ones? All of them? Even the tiny little helper classes? I tend to try to test every method, but am I doing this wrong? </li> 
    <li> Should I have some integration tests? How would I even achieve that? (I guess this one is pretty project-specific, but I still wonder.) </li>
  </ul>
    
  <p> In my personal experience, comprehensive unit testing has saved me a lot of trouble. It's costly to do up-front and your non-developer coworkers might question why simple features tend to take you so long, but you will more than make up for the time when your program works well and you can identify bugs very quickly. I <i>love</i> my end-to-end tests and I would hate to try to "verify" that my program was working by crawling through application logs and hoping everything looked right. When in doubt, write a test! Your future self will thank you. </p>
